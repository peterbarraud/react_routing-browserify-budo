# Rapid Prototyping with Browserify+Budo and ReactJSRouting

I've created the simplest possible routing project.

OK so, *simplest possible* may be hyperbole. But it is pretty simple.

Everything all in one `main.js`

Ok enought with the preamble, just do this

1. Clone this repo
1. Open your command prompt in the cloned dir
1. Type `npm i`
1. Type `npm start`

And try the different routes.

Super straightforward
